# ToDo:
- [ ] Make canvas point scalar not a magic number
- [ ] Move some generic functions out into a utility functions file
- [ ] Raytracing desperatly needs optimisation, potentially triangles need to only store vertex indicies, remove pass by values, prevent copying where possible

# ToDone:
- [X] Add wireframe rendering to the 3D renderer so it utilise movement controls
- [X] Add raytracing
    - [X] Ray-triangle intersection
    - [X] Validate intersection
    - [X] Occlusion Shadows
    - [X] Sort out acne
    - [X] Fix colours
    - [X] Fix orientation
    
- [X] Add controls for switching between wireframe, raytraced and rasterized
